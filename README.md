# setpaths-cli
A CLI command to set up a folder structure for development.

This will create a development folder structure in ${your_home_directory}/Documents/dev

## How to
```
 1. sudo npm i -g @hakansundstrom/setpaths-cli
 2. run 'setpaths createfolders' from your terminal, this will create a .zshrc_aliases in your home folder.
 3. Add following line to your ${homedir}/.zshrc file: source ~/.zshrc_aliases
 4. Done! Open a new shell and write something like 'p.dev' or 'p.sandbox' or 'p.node' to terminal, all paths have these shortcuts now.
```

All paths are accesible from terminal via 'p.{folderName}'.
The terminal will also display what folders and files are in there.

You can also fork this from github to a custom folder.

Execute this by entering 'node ${path-to-this-folder}/setpaths'. 

Customise your folder structure and paths in the fullPaths object as you'd like.
